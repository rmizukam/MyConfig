going to list the important and most used git commands that I use
All commands are done through the terminal after navigating to the repo folder

-1) Adding A New Comp To The GitHub ssh
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@server.com"
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
git config --global user.email "MY_NAME@example.com
git config --global user.name "FIRST_NAME LAST_NAME"

3) Staging Files to Repository. Must Be Done When New Files Are Created.
command to stage ALL files:

If you want to add certain files but not all you can just add to the list after FileName
